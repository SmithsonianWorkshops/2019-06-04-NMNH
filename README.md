# Genome Annotation Workshop 

**June 4-5, 2019**  

**Location: NMNH - Rose Room**  

**Time: 9:00 AM - 4:30 PM**

In this workshop, we will use AUGUSTUS (Stanke et al. 2006) to annotate an eukaryotic genome, and in the end, we will generate a genome browser to visualize the annotation.

We will be taking notes using this Etherpad: https://pad.carpentries.org/2019-06-04-NMNH
